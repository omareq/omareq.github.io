# Meshing

This is a mesh generation program based on [Delaunay Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).  The mesh is created from a randomly generated set of points on a plane.  The convex hull for this plane is calculated using the [Graham Scan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan) algorithm and the mesh is calculated for the given convex shape.
