# Quadruped

A quick mock up of a quadruped design to test Inverse Kinematics for a robot
that I have built.

Check out the [Demo](https://omareq.github.io/quadruped/).
Check out the [Docs](https://omareq.github.io/quadruped/docs/).
Created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).
Created using [chart.js](https://chartjs.org/).
Gif Created using [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/).

## Example

Simulation of the quadruped robot running through a forward kinematic gait
sequence.  This gait sequence is statically stable and only one leg is moved at
a time.
