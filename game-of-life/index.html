              <h2> Cellular Automata </h2>
              <p>
                The Game of Life, initially dubbed Life, was created by John
                Conway a British Mathematician and is talked about in
                <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/sts145/Library/life.pdf">
                  Scientific American
                </a>
                inOctober 1970.  Life is an example of what is known as a
                cellular automata.  Cellular automata are discrete simulations
                with a very basic rule set that can be used to study advanced
                mathematics.  I personally enjoy how complex things can arise
                from such simple rules, some people have gone so far as to
                design miniature computers out the elements of the game of life.
              </p>

              <p>
                Generally in cellular automata there is some grid type structure
                which can contain some form of life, which is usually denoted
                by a state.  In the game of life this is 0 or 1, alive or dead,
                however this can take any number of possible combinations.  Each
                cell can communicate with it's neighbouring cells, this can be
                just the immediate cells next to it, up, down, left and right or
                it can reach further out than that.  This communication lets the
                cell figure out how it should change it's own state for the next
                generation which is dictated by the rules of the game.  Due to
                the fact that the game can be run just by setting the initial
                states of all the cells with no further input it is known as a
                zero-player game.

              <h2> Rules </h2>
              <!-- <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules">Wikipedia</a></p> -->

              <p>
                The rules for state changes between generations in Life are
                shown below.
              </p>

              <ul class="list-group">
                <li class="list-group-item"> <b>1)</b> Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"> <b>2)</b> Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"> <b>3)</b> Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
                <li class="list-group-item"> <b>4)</b> Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
