# Random-walk

Generate a random walk within a grid based on the work of Dan from the coding
train.  The difference between this random walk and normal ones is that it is
self avoiding.  This means that the path does not cross itself.

## Example
Here's an image of an example self avoiding walk:

This self avoiding walk differs from others by being on a non rectangular
lattice.  This is implemented by creating lattice vectors to represent the grid
points.  Other lattices can be implemented by changing the lattice vectors.
