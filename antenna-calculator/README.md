# Antenna Dimensions Calculator

I have been making antennas for a while now and I have realised that I have gotten into the bad habbit of actually doing the same calculation to get the dimensions over and over again.  Obviously I should know better by now.  Anyway I decided to write up the calculations verry quickly and then to make a quick animation of the results.
