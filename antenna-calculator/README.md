# Antenna Dimensions Calculator

I have been making antennas for a while now and I have realised that I have gotten into the bad habbit of actually doing the same calculation to get the dimensions over and over again.  Obviously I should know better by now.  Anyway I decided to write up the calculations verry quickly and then to make a quick animation of the results. Checkout the [Demo](https://omareq.github.io/antenna-calculator/).

Animations created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

## To do list

[ ] Figure out why the first and last vertex of the helix are connected

[ ]	Figure out how to pause animation when active tab is changed

[x]	Add slider to adjust helix resolution

[x]	Add switch polarisation state by adding pi

[ ]	Add HPBW (Half Power Beam Width)

[ ]	Draw reflector dish

[ ]	Update animations to show dimensions of antenna

[ ]	Create stop animation option that displays static image with dimensions

[ ]	Create schematic export to pdf or some other format

[ ]	Add different antenna types

[ ]	Add inverse calculation, ie antenna frequency from dimensions
