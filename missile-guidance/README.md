# missile-guidance

A program looking into the various methods of missile targeting.  I have
started with [pursuit homing](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pursuit_guidance) and have
moved on to exploring [proportional navigation](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_navigation).
Further studies will include true proportional navigation, augmented proportional
navigation, [motion camoflage](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_camouflage) and 
perhaps if I am feeling bold I shall venture into optimal control theory.

Created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
