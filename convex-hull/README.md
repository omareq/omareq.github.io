# convex-hull

This is a brief project inspired by Daniel Shiffman of [The Coding Train](https://thecodingtrain.com).  Convex hull generation has many applications in computer graphics and mathematics.  Personally I am interested in how it leads to mesh generation which has applications in finite element analysis.
