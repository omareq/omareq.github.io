                <h2>What is a convex hull?</h2>
                <p>
                    In geometry a convex hull, also known as a convex envelope,
                    of a set of points is the smallest convex set that contains
                    it.  For a set of points on a 2D plane this can be thought
                    of as the hull that is created by a rubber band that
                    stretches around it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are many uses of convex hulls in mathematics however
                    I am personally interested in their use in computational
                    simulations.  If a convex hull of a set of points can be
                    generated then that set of points can be meshed knowing that
                    the entire problem space has been covered.  This can then
                    lead on to any number of finite element methods used to
                    simulate real world physics.

                    in the special case that the set of points is on a 2D plane.
                    It was published by R. A. Jarvis in

                    Starting from a leftmost point of the data set, we keep the
                    points in the convex hull by anti-clockwise rotation.  From
                    a current point, we can choose the next point by checking
                    the orientations of those points from the current point.
                    When the angle is largest, the point is chosen.  After
                    completing all points, when the next point is the start
                    point, stop the algorithm.

                    is an algorithm design concept which is
                    based in multiple branch recursion.  A problem is broken
                    down into smaller and smaller problems which can be solved
                    directly and the answers combined to solve the original
                    problem.  In the convex hull generation problem the basic element
                    would be three points making a triangle.  The solution used
                    however does not go use that many recursive steps.  In
                    actuality this was solved iteratively for the sake of
                    improving the ease of animation but this can be done in
                    parallel on multiple processors with limited memory sharing.

                <p>
                    In this example the points are sorted and then separated
                    equally into three subsets.  These subsets are individually
                    processed and the convex hull is generated for each using
                    the gift wrapping algorithm.  The three convex hulls are
                    then combined to form a new set of points for which the
                    final convex hull will be computed.  It is important to note
                    that whilst the points are sorted for visual clarity this is
                    not necessary and even if the convex hulls for the subsets
                    overlap the merge will still work successfully.

                    algorithm is another method of creating a convex hull from
                    a set of points in a 2d plane.  It was developed by A. M.
                    Andrew and published in

                    at the end of April 1979 and was revised later on in the
                    year.

                    First the points are sorted
                    by x coordinate and in case of a tie by y coordinate.  First
                    the upper hull is generated starting at the left most point
                    travelling in a clockwise manner and is finished at the
                    right most point.  Each subsequent point is chosen by
                    comparing the orientations of every point from the current
                    point.  When the angle is largest, the point is chosen.
                    This is duplicated for the lower hull
                    and then the two hulls are combined to create the final
                    convex hull.

                </p>
                    It should be noted that this can be partially simplified
                    when calculating the lower hull by removing all points in
                    the upper hull from comparisons except for the left most
                    point.  This differs from the divide and conquer method due
                    to the fact that every point is in consideration for both
                    the upper and lower hull, the problem space has not been
                    reduced to a simpler problem.

                    algorithm, like the monotone chain algorithm, is a convex
                    hull generation algorithm that has a time complexity faster
                    than the gift wrapping algorithm as it does not depend on
                    the number of hull points, this is true as long as the
                    number of hull points is more than <i>logn</i> for the gift
                    wrapping algorithm.  It is also limited to a 2D plane.  It
                    is named after Ronald Graham who published the algorithm in
                    <a href="http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/72_10_convex_hull.pdf">

                   First the lowest point in the set is found, if there are two
                   then the leftmost point is used.  Next the points are sorted
                   with respect to the angle that they make between the lowest
                   point and the x axis.  For each point the previous two points
                   are checked to see if they are going in a clock wise or
                   counter clockwise direction.  If the turn is deemed to be
                   clockwise then the second to last point is not in the convex
                   hull and it is rejected.  The current point keeps checking
                   the previous points until it reaches a counter clockwise
                   turn, when this happens the current point is added to the
                   convex hull and the algorithm moves on to the next point.
                   This continues until the algorithm reaches the point at which
                   it started.
