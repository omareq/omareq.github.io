# Multiple Canvas

Have been looking for a way to draw multiple canvases to a single webpage.  This
has been acomplished by using the
[instance mode of p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/instance-mode-instantiation.html).
I am not yet sure if this works properly when using the WEBGL renderer, but I
shall hopefully soon find out.

Checkout the [Demo](https://omareq.github.io/multiple-canvas/).
Checkout the [Docs](https://omareq.github.io/multiple-canvas/docs).
Created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

## TODO

- [ ]   Code example using [googlearchive/code-prettify](https://github.com/googlearchive/code-prettify)
