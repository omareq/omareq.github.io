# Multiple Canvas

Have been looking for a way to draw multiple canvases to a single webpage.  This has been acomplished by using the [instance mode of p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/instance-mode-instantiation.html).  I am not yet sure if this works properly when using the WEBGL renderer, but I shall hopefully soon find out. Checkout the [Demo](https://omareq.github.io/multiple-canvas/).

Created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)
