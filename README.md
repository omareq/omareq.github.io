Over the years I have made a lot of very small and fun programs on my computer.  I have decided to start converting a lot of them to use JavaScript so that I can leave it online for people to enjoy.  I have never been officially taught how to program so if you see anything that could be improved let me know and I will give it a go.

For now just enjoy my mini library of fun [here](https://omareq.github.io/).

## Todo

- [ ]   Testing, make sure that all js files are linked in index.html, spell check, markdown validator, html validator
