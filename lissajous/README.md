# Lissajous Pattern

Created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

I have recentliy spent alot of time in an electrical engineers lab and have been using the osciliscopes to test the functionality of various pieces of hardware.  I spent some of that time making lissajous patterns and well now i want somewhere to go and look at them more often. Check out the [Demo](https://omareq.github.io/lissajous).
