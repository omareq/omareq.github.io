# Langton's Ant

Created using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)

Langton's ant with added extra 'antState' variable.  This variable along with the state of the grid at the ants position effect which way the ant moves.  This new type of Langton's ant is called a [turmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite).
