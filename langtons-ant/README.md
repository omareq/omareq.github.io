# Langton's Ant


Langton's ant with added extra 'antState' variable.  This variable along with the state of the grid at the ants position effect which way the ant moves.  This new type of Langton's ant is called a [turmite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turmite).

Check out the [Demo](https://omareq.github.io/langtons-ant/). How long are you willing to wait to see if you will get the superhighway?
